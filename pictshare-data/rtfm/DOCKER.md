### Docker Compose With Prebuild Image by hascheksolutions

Run container by docker-compose:
- First, install docker compose:
[Docker official docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Pull docker-compose file:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HaschekSolutions/pictshare/master/docker-compose.yml
```
- Edit docker-compose file:
```bash
vi docker-compose.yml
```
- Run container by docker-compose:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

By using this compose file, you should know that:
- Will make a directory "volumes" in the same directory where compose file is.
- Change `AUTOUPDATE` to false from true by defalt.
- And...it is highly recommended to build your own image.
